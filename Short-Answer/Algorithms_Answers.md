#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)   Linear Time


b) O(n^n)  


c) O(n)  Linear Time

## Exercise II

1. We let n be the number or stories in the building 


2. We will let f be the height at which an egg breaks 


If n is greater than f then egg is broken, stop wasting egg 

While f is less than n           O(n)
drop egg                     O(1)
move up another floor        O(1)
total runtime = O(n)
